    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In week four we've learned about a few different classifiers. In week five we'll learn about webscraping, APIs, and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Now we're going to put those skills to the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "For project 3, your goal is two-fold:\n",
    "1. Using Reddit's API, you'll collect posts from two subreddits of your choosing.\n",
    "2. You'll then use NLP to train a classifier on which subreddit a given post came from. This is a binary classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### About the API\n",
    "\n",
    "Reddit's API is fairly straightforward. For example, if I want the posts from [`/r/boardgames`](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames), all I have to do is add `.json` to the end of the url: https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames.json\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you get started, we have a primer video on how to use Reddit's API: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Y3ZE26Ciuk\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gather and prepare your data using the `requests` library.\n",
    "- **Create and compare two models**. One of these must be a Bayes classifier, however the other can be a classifier of your choosing: logistic regression, KNN, SVM, etc.\n",
    "- A Jupyter Notebook with your analysis for a peer audience of data scientists.\n",
    "- An executive summary of the results you found.\n",
    "- A short presentation outlining your process and findings for a semi-technical audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro Tip 1:** You can find a good example executive summary [here](https://www.proposify.biz/blog/executive-summary).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro Tip 2:** Reddit will give you 25 posts **per request**. To get enough data, you'll need to hit Reddit's API **repeatedly** (most likely in a `for` loop). _Be sure to use the `time.sleep()` function at the end of your loop to allow for a break in between requests. **THIS IS CRUCIAL**_\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro tip 3:** The API will cap you at 1,000 posts for each subreddit (assuming the subreddit has that many posts).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro tip 4:** At the end of each loop, be sure to save the results from your scrape as a `csv`: JSON from Reddit > Pandas DataFrame > CSV. That way, if something goes wrong in your loop, you won't lose all your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Necessary Deliverables / Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code and executive summary must be in a clearly commented Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "- You must submit your slide deck.\n",
    "- Materials must be submitted by **9:00 AM on Monday, Mar 22nd 2021**.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Rubric\n",
    "Your local instructor will evaluate your project (for the most part) using the following criteria.  You should make sure that you consider and/or follow most if not all of the considerations/recommendations outlined below **while** working through your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Project 3 the evaluation categories are as follows:<br>\n",

    "### Why we choose this project for you?\n",
    "This project covers three of the biggest concepts we cover in the class: Classification Modeling, Natural Language Processing and Data Wrangling/Acquisition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 1 of the project focuses on **Data wrangling/gathering/acquisition**. This is a very important skill as not all the data you will need will be in clean CSVs or a single table in SQL.  There is a good chance that wherever you land you will have to gather some data from some unstructured/semi-structured sources; when possible, requesting information from an API, but often scraping it because they don't have an API (or it's terribly documented).\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 2 of the project focuses on **Natural Language Processing** and converting standard text data (like Titles and Comments) into a format that allows us to analyze it and use it in modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 3 of the project focuses on **Classification Modeling**.  Given that project 2 was a regression focused problem, we needed to give you a classification focused problem to practice the various models, means of assessment and preprocessing associated with classification.   \n"
